//Very obscure code to trigger a problem in the code generator where an expression in a grandchild could theoretically
//be evaluated in the child query, but it would have a different meaning.
//In this case the SET(DATASET()) expression is dependent on LEFT(dsOuter).  That could be evaluated in the outer
//project or the nexsted project.  When the graph for the child query is processed the code needs to ensure that
//it is not hoisted.
//Two solutions:
//1. The child query is traversed, and for any operators that introduce the a selector that is already in scope all
//   child expressions are marked to prevent hoisting.  (Even if the expression also occurs outside.)
//2. Any expression that in introduces a selector that is already inscope is not transformed, but any selectors it
//   contains are remapped.

//The expression needs to be walked, and
//
//It generally requires LEFT rather than a dataset (e.g. complexhoist4) because when a dataset is resourced it
//has a unique id appended - which disambiguates it from the child dataset.

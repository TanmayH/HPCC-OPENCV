# This file defines custom ESP tag names in a windows ini format.
# At present, only [global] section is supported which defines 
# desired ESP names for each name generated by Ecl2Esp.  For e.g.,
# if ECL name is company_name and if Ecl2Esp translates it as 
# CompanyName and you would like it to be translated as Company 
# instead then define:
#
# [global]
# CompanyName=Company
